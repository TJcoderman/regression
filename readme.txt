ðŸ“Š Regression Algorithms in Python
Welcome to my Regression Algorithms project repository! ðŸŽ‰ This project explores different regression techniques in Python, ranging from simple linear regression to more complex multiple and polynomial regression models. Whether you're here to learn, test, or simply explore, there's something for everyone!

ðŸ§  Algorithms Covered
In this project, I experimented with three types of regression algorithms:

Linear Regression:
The simplest form of regression, used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on a single independent variable. Think of it as drawing the best-fit straight line between points.

Multiple Regression:
What if thereâ€™s more than one influencing factor? Multiple regression steps in to predict the dependent variable using multiple independent variables. We move from a straight line to a plane or hyperplane!

Polynomial Regression:
Sometimes data isn't linear at all! Polynomial regression models data as an nth degree polynomial, allowing for more flexibility and better predictions for complex datasets.
